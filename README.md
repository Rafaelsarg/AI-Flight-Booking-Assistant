### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop an AI-based chatbot that can help people book airline tickets. The chatbot will be able to answer questions about flights, such as the price of tickets, the availability of flights, and the terms and conditions of travel. The chatbot will be targeted at people who are looking to book airline tickets. It will help users find the best deals on flights. 

### Project details

#### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

The chatbot will use a combination of rule-based and AI-based NLU to understand user queries. The combination of rule-based and AI-based NLU will help to get better accuracy when understanding user queries. The rule-based NLU will be able to understand common patterns in user queries, while the AI-based NLU will be able to understand more complex user queries. This will allow the chatbot to understand a wider range of user queries and provide more accurate responses.

#### Belief State Tracking (BST)

The chatbot will use a beliefs state tracking system to keep track of the user's goals and preferences. The beliefs state tracking system will be used to ensure that the chatbot's responses are relevant to the user's current goals. 

#### Natural Language Generation (NLG)

The chatbot will use a template-based NLG system to generate responses to user queries. The templates will be used to ensure that the chatbot's responses are consistent and grammatically correct. The NLG system will also be able to generate responses that are personalized to the user, such as by including the user's name in the response.
